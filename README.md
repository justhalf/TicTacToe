[FAQ]
Q: What is generalized Tic Tac Toe?
A: Given a MxN board, let k = min(M,N). Two players alternatively put X and O mark until one of them manages to a consecutive sequence of k marks either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. If none did so until the board filled up, it's a draw.

Q: What is a 'default game'?
A: A default game is a 3x3 board. You can choose your own board size by typing 'n' at the corresponding prompt.
